Universal Knowledge Chatbot
One of our biggest challenges is making large, complex information easy to access. Whether it’s a 200-page PDF, a book, a structured database, or data coming from external APIs — people waste too much time searching, reading, or trying to query data manually.

🛠️ Your Challenge
Build a chatbot web app that can answer questions from different types of sources:
📄 Files (documents, PDFs, books):

 Upload a file and ask questions like “What are the main takeaways of Chapter 3?” or “Summarize this contract in simple terms.”


🗄️ Databases (with multiple tables):

 Connect to a database and ask things like “Show me the top 10 customers by revenue last quarter” or “Which orders are still pending shipment?”


🔗 APIs / External services:

 Query external APIs (weather, finance, sports, etc.) and ask: “What’s the forecast in Salt Lake City tomorrow?” or “Give me today’s exchange rate for USD to MXN.”


⚠️ The system must have Single Sign-On (SSO) so only internal people can access it.

💡 What We Expect
A working prototype chatbot that can handle at least one of these source types (bonus if you can support more).
Big bonus points in judging if you are able to tie into Jira, GitHub, and Slack, and the AI can answer questions like, “In the previous 6 months, how many tickets/issues have been worked on with area of functionality X? Who worked on those issues?”
Use AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Lovable, n8n, Replit, etc.) to make the chatbot smart and natural.
Think both product + technical solution:
How will the user choose or connect the source (file, DB, or API)?
How will you manage context so answers stay accurate?
What’s the UX — a simple chat box, or something more advanced?
✅ Scope Clarifications
You don’t need to support all three sources (files, DBs, APIs). Supporting one well is enough for a strong demo — bonus points if you support more.
Sample/mock data is fine — no need to connect to production databases.
For files, you can work with shorter or pre-prepared examples (no need to process entire 200+ page books if that’s too heavy).
For databases, you can simulate with SQLite/Postgres and mock tables instead of connecting to complex systems.
⚡ The more complete and polished (multi-source, context-aware, user-friendly) your chatbot is, the higher your chances to win.
